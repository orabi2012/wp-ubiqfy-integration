## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **PostgreSQL** (v13 or higher) or **MySQL** (v8 or higher)
- **wp Partner Account** with app credentials
- **Ubiqfy API credentials** (username, password, terminal key)
- **SSL Certificate** (required for production webhook handling)

### Security Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
APP_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password  
DB_DATABASE=wp_ubiqfy_integration
DB_SSL_ENABLED=true

# Security Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-min-32-chars
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-256-bit-encryption-key-64-hex-chars

# wp API Configuration (Auto-configured via webhooks)
wp_BASE_URL=https://api.wp.dev/admin/v2
wp_AUTH_BASE=https://accounts.wp.sa/oauth2
wp_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY=your_webhook_secret

# Ubiqfy API Configuration
PRODUCTION_UBIQFY_URL=https://api.ubiqfy.com
SANDBOX_UBIQFY_URL=https://api-sandbox.ubiqfy.com
```

> **🔐 Security Note**: Generate a secure 256-bit encryption key for `ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Use `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate one.

> **📝 Important**: wp client credentials (ID/Secret) are **automatically obtained** during app installation via webhooks - no manual configuration required!

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/orabi2012/wp-ubiqfy-integration.git
cd wp-ubiqfy-integration
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up the database**
```bash
# Run database migrations
npm run migration:run
```

4. **Start the application**
```bash
# Development mode with hot reload
npm run start:dev

# Production mode  
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### wp App Configuration

This integration uses **automatic webhook-based setup** with zero manual configuration!

1. **Create wp Partner Account**: Register at [wp Partners](https://wp.partners)

2. **Create App with Webhook Configuration**:
   - **App Type**: Private or Public App
   - **Webhook URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/wp-webhook/handle`
   - **Required Scopes**: 
     - `read:products` - Read product catalog
     - `write:products` - Create/update products
   - **Webhook Events**: 
     - `app.installed` - Handle app installation
     - `app.store.authorize` - Receive OAuth tokens
     - `app.uninstalled` - Handle app removal
     - `product.deleted` - Sync product deletions

3. **Automatic Installation Flow**:
   ```
   Merchant Installs App → app.installed webhook → Store record created
   ↓
   Merchant Authorizes → app.store.authorize webhook → OAuth tokens received
   ↓
   System auto-registers webhooks → Redirects to setup page
   ↓
   Merchant enters Ubiqfy credentials → Integration ready!
   ```

> **🎯 Key Advantages**: 
> - No manual OAuth flow implementation needed
> - Zero credential management complexity  
> - Automatic webhook registration and management
> - Seamless merchant onboarding experience

### Ubiqfy Integration Setup
